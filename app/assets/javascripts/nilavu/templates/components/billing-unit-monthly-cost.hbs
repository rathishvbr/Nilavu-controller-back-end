If MB/SSD is clicked then you will be able to see 'MB/GB/TB' for MB & SSD/HDD for SSD in a dropdown. Once the user enters the new number then the Usage estimator is updated. Also with CORES - the way it works is it's bundled with RAM. This is to avoid heavy CPU abuse. It's a preset of something like 1 vCPU per 2048MB ram, anything under 2048 gets 1vCPU.  -->
